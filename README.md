# Impact of Genotyping Platform and Quality Control on Genomic Prediction Accuracy of Soybean Oil Composition


## Overview

This repository contains the supplementary data files associated with the manuscript titled **"Impact of Genotyping Platform and Quality Control on Genomic Prediction Accuracy of Soybean Oil Composition
"** by Melina Prado, Regina Helena Geribello Priolli, Evellyn Giselly De Oliveira Couto, Felipe Sabadin, Kaio Olimpio das Graças Dias, and José Baldin Pinheiro.

## Repository Structure

The repository includes the following:
- Phenotypes.csv: The raw phenotyping data of the traits used, such as soybean oil fatty acid composition (expressed as a percentage) and total oil content (expressed as grams of oil per 100 grams of seed).
- SNP_6K.csv: The genomic data obtained from the DNA array genotyping platform.
- SNP_GBS.csv: The genomic data obtained from the GBS genotyping platform.
